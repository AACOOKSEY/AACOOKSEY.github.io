        "abstract": "\u2022Event-driven behavior trees extension for multi-agent coordination in video games.\u2022Three new types of nodes for coordination are proposed.\u2022New nodes allow agents to communicate through a request protocol.\u2022A complete implementation and an application example are provided.\u2022Unlike ad hoc solutions, our approach favors behavior trees\u2019 development paradigm. In this paper, we extend behavior trees (BTs), a behavior creation method that is popular in the video game industry, with three new types of nodes that facilitate the design and implementation of non-player characters (NPCs) that need to coordinate with each other. We provide an implementation and a methodology to use the coordination nodes of our extension appropriately, and we show how to use them to develop an application scenario. In the last years, coordination in multi-agent systems has been a very active research field, both from theoretical and practical points of view. Something similar has happened with the development of new tools for the video game industry. Our approach contributes to both areas by providing a novel extension that facilitates the design and implementation of agents that need to coordinate with each other. In video games, agents or NPCs are\u2014as their name implies\u2014characters that are not controlled by the player but by the game through an algorithmic, predetermined, or responsive behavior, or a more sophisticated AI technique. Some video games require NPCs with dynamic, credible, and intelligently unpredictable behaviors to keep players engaged and immersed. Instead of endowing NPCs with very complex individual behaviors, a feasible way to improve their unpredictability in an intelligent and credible manner is allowing them to coordinate with each other. Since BTs focus on the creation of individual behaviors, coordinated behaviors nowadays tend to be achieved by hard-coding the coordination itself. However, that ad hoc solution partially drives away some of the benefits that popularized BTs: Being visually intuitive, scalable, and reusable. For this reason, we propose an extension to BTs that developers can use to coordinate NPCs without going against the development paradigm: creating complex behaviors by designing an intuitive tree structure.",

        "abstract": "The process of play testing a game is subjective, expensive and incomplete. In this paper, we present a play-testing approach that explores the game space with automated agents and collects data to answer questions posed by the designers. Rather than have agents interacting with an actual game client, this approach recreates the bare bone mechanics of the game as a separate system. Our agent is able to play in minutes what would take testers days of organic gameplay. The analysis of thousands of game simulations exposed imbalances in game actions, identified inconsequential rewards and evaluated the effectiveness of optional strategic choices. Our test case game, The Sims Mobile, was recently released and the findings shown here influenced design changes that resulted in improved player experience.",

        "abstract": "Despite impressive advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based gameplaying in recent years, many such systems still lack the capability of robustly dealing with novelty in a sufficiently rich environment. Novelty may be operationally described as the states or situations that violate (implicit or explicit) assumptions about agents, the environment, and agent\u2013agent and agent\u2013environment interactions. In this article, we describe a simulation platform called GNOME (Generating Novelty in Open-World Multi-agent Environments) that was developed to support the development, training and evaluation of AI agents designed to play the strategic four-player board game of Monopoly. Specifically, GNOME evaluates the ability of these agents to detect and react to novelty that is potentially unanticipated by agent developers, and is one of the first gameplaying simulators to treat novelty as a first-class citizen. We hope that its introduction will lead to both practitioner-oriented and fundamental research on the nature of novelty and its impacts on AI gameplaying.",

        "abstract": "The success of human civilization is rooted in our ability to cooperate by communicating and making joint plans. We study how artificial agents may use communication to better cooperate in Diplomacy, a long-standing AI challenge. We propose negotiation algorithms allowing agents to agree on contracts regarding joint plans, and show they outperform agents lacking this ability. For humans, misleading others about our intentions forms a barrier to cooperation. Diplomacy requires reasoning about our opponents' future plans, enabling us to study broken commitments between agents and the conditions for honest cooperation. We find that artificial agents face a similar problem as humans: communities of communicating agents are susceptible to peers who deviate from agreements. To defend against this, we show that the inclination to sanction peers who break contracts dramatically reduces the advantage of such deviators. Hence, sanctioning helps foster mostly truthful communication, despite conditions that initially favor deviations from agreements.",

        "abstract": "Ticket to Ride is a popular contemporary board game for two to four players, featuring a number of expansions with additional maps and tweaks to the core game mechanics. In this paper, four different game-playing agents that embody different playing styles are deifned and used to analyze Ticket to Ride. Different playing styles are shown to be effective depending on the map and rule variation, and also depending on how many players play the game. The performance profiles of the different agents can be used to characterize maps and identify the most similar maps in the space of playstyles. Further analysis of the automatically played games reveal which cities on the map are most desirable, and that the relative attractiveness of cities is remarkably consistent across numbers of players. Finally, the automated analysis also reveals two classes of failures states, where the agents find states which are not covered by the game rules; this is akin to finding bugs in the rules. We see the analysis performed here as a possible template for AI-based playtesting of contemporary board games.",

        "abstract": "Modeling and predicting player behavior is of the utmost importance in game development and matchmaking A variety of methods have been proposed to build artificial intelligence (AI), human-like players. However, these human-like players have a limited ability to imitate the behavior of individual players. In this paper, we propose a player behavior imitation method using imitation learning under the framework of meta-learning. A generic behavior model of game players was learned from historical records using adversarial imitation learning. Then, we personalized the policy by imitating the behavior of each individual player. Convolutional neural networks were used to construct the feature extractor of game board states. The experiments were conducted using the Reversi game, and 18,000 game records of different players were used to train the generic behavior model. The behavior of each new player was learned using only hundreds of records. The results demonstrate that our method can be utilized to imitate individual behavior in terms of action similarity well.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of designing novel techniques for multi- player game playing, in a range of board games and configurations. Compared to the well-known case of two-player game playing, multi-player game playing is a more complex problem with unique requirements. To address the unique challenges of this domain, we examine the potential of employing techniques inspired by Adaptive Data Structures (ADSs) to rank opponents based on their relative threats, and using this information to achieve gains in move ordering and tree pruning. We name our new technique the Threat-ADS heuristic. We examine the Threat-ADS\u2019 performance within a range of game models, employing a number of different, well-understood update mechanisms for ADSs. We then extend our analysis to specifically consider intermediate board states, which are more interesting than the initial board state, as we do not assume the availability of \u201cOpening book\u201d moves, and where substantial variation can exist, in terms of available moves and threatening opponents. We expand this analysis to include an exploration of the Threat-ADS heuristic\u2019s performance in deeper ply game trees, to confirm that it maintains its benefits even when lookahead is greater, and with an expanded examination of how the number of players present in the game impacts the performance of the Threat-ADS heuristic. We find that in nearly all environments, the Threat-ADS heuristic is able to produce meaningful, statistically significant improvements in tree pruning, demonstrating that it serves as a very reliable move ordering heuristic for multi-player game playing under a wide range of configurations, thus motivating the use of ADS-based techniques within the field of game playing.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the development of computer games has shown a tremendous surge. The ease and speed of internet access today have also influenced the development of computer games, especially computer games that are played online. Internet technology has allowed computer games to be played in multiplayer mode. Interaction between players in a computer game can be built in several ways, one of which is by providing balanced opponents. Opponents can be developed using intelligent agents. On the other hand, research on developing intelligent agents is also growing rapidly. In computer game development, one of the easiest ways to measure the performance of an intelligent agent is to develop a virtual environment that allows the intelligent agent to interact with other players. In this research, we try to develop an intelligent agent and virtual environment for the board game. To be easily accessible, the intelligent agent and virtual environment are then developed into an Application Programming Interface (API) service called Gapoera API. The Gapoera API service that is built is expected to help game developers develop a game without having to think much about the artificial intelligence that will be embedded in the game. This service provides a basic multilevel intelligent agent that can provide users with playing board games commonly played in Indonesia. Although the Gapoera API can be used for various types of games, in this paper, we will focus on the discussion on a popular traditional board game in Indonesia, namely Mancala. The test results conclude that the multilevel agent concept developed has worked as expected. On the other hand, the development of the Gapoera API service has also been successfully accessed on several game platforms.",

Unlike the agents built to \"beat the game,\" our agents aim to produce human-like behavior to help with game evaluation and balancing. We discuss two fundamental metrics based on which we measure the human-likeness of agents, namely skill and style, which are multifaceted concepts with practical implications outlined in this article. We report four case studies in which the style and skill requirements inform the choice of algorithms and metrics used to train agents; ranging from A* search to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL). Furthermore, we, show that the learning potential of state-of-the-art deep RL models does not seamlessly transfer from the benchmark environments to target ones without heavily tuning their hyperparameters, leading to linear scaling of the engineering efforts, and computational cost with the number of target domains.",
